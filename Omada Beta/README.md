# Home Assistant Omada Add-On Beta

This add-on brings the Omada Controller Beta directly into Home Assistant.

For upgrade from v5 to v6 please read the notes on the main README.

## Contribution

This add-on was originally inspired by Matt Bentleys
[docker-omada-controller](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller)
and jkunczik [home-assistant-omada](https://github.com/jkunczik/home-assistant-omada)
would not have been possible without their excellent work.
Other than in the original docker omada controller,
this add-on stores all persistent data in the /data directory,
so that it is compatible with Home Assistant.
This Add-On would not be possible without the effort of other people.
Pull requests for version updates or new features are always more than welcome.
Special thanks goes to DraTrav for pushing this Add-On forward!
